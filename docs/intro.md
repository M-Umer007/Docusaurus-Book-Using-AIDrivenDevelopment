# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## About This Book

This textbook introduces **Physical AI** — AI systems that operate in the real, physical world through robots. Unlike traditional AI that lives purely in software, Physical AI connects intelligence with sensors, actuators, and physical laws.

This book focuses on **humanoid robotics**, where AI systems are embodied in human-like forms capable of perception, reasoning, and action.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is designed for:
- Students with basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Learners familiar with AI or software development
- Anyone interested in robotics, embodied intelligence, and AI agents

No prior robotics experience is required.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this book, you will be able to:
- Understand principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Use **ROS 2** to control robots
- Simulate robots using **Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim**
- Build AI-powered perception and navigation systems
- Integrate **Vision, Language, and Action (VLA)**
- Create an autonomous humanoid robot in simulation

## How This Book Is Structured

- **Chapter 1:** Foundations of Physical AI and ROS 2  
- **Chapter 2:** Simulation and Digital Twins  
- **Chapter 3:** AI-Robot Brain using NVIDIA Isaac  
- **Chapter 4:** Vision-Language-Action and Autonomous Humanoids  

Each chapter builds on the previous one and includes conceptual explanations and practical workflows.

## Learning Philosophy

This is an **AI-native textbook**:
- Designed to be read alongside AI assistants
- Optimized for experimentation and exploration
- Focused on real-world deployment, not just theory

Let’s begin the journey from **digital intelligence to physical action**.

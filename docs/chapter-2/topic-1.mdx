# Topic 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

To build and control humanoid robots, understanding **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)** is essential. ROS 2 acts as the **nervous system** of the robot, handling communication between software components, sensors, and actuators.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides:

- **Nodes:** Independent processes that perform computation  
- **Topics:** Channels for nodes to publish or subscribe to messages  
- **Services:** Request/response interactions between nodes  
- **Actions:** Long-running tasks with feedback and result  
- **Parameters:** Configurable settings for nodes  

ROS 2 supports multiple programming languages, with **Python (`rclpy`)** and **C++ (`rclcpp`)** being the most common.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes

- A **node** is a single executable that communicates with other nodes  
- Examples: camera node, motor controller node, AI perception node  
- Nodes can be distributed across multiple machines  

### Topics

- **Publish-subscribe communication**  
- Publishers send messages to a topic  
- Subscribers receive messages from a topic  
- Example: `/camera/image_raw` publishes camera images  

### Services

- **Synchronous communication**  
- One node requests, another responds  
- Example: Resetting a robot’s pose or querying sensor status  

### Actions

- For tasks that take time and provide feedback  
- Example: Move a robotic arm to a target while reporting progress  

### Parameters

- Configurable values for nodes  
- Example: Maximum speed, PID gains, sensor thresholds

## ROS 2 Communication Patterns

| Pattern         | Use Case                                           | Communication Type |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Publisher-Subscriber | Continuous sensor data, AI commands             | Asynchronous     |
| Service          | Requesting a specific operation                  | Synchronous      |
| Action           | Long-running tasks with feedback                 | Asynchronous     |
| Parameter        | Configuration of nodes                            | Synchronous/Async |

## Why ROS 2 is Critical for Physical AI

- Handles **real-time sensor data**  
- Coordinates **multi-node systems** across machines  
- Integrates with **simulation environments** like Gazebo and Isaac Sim  
- Bridges AI models to **physical actuators**

## Getting Started with ROS 2

1. Install ROS 2 Humble/Iron on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
2. Create a workspace (`colcon` build system)  
3. Write your first Python node using `rclpy`  
4. Run a publisher and subscriber to verify communication  

By mastering ROS 2 fundamentals, you lay the foundation for **writing nodes, simulating robots, and integrating AI agents**, which will be covered in the next topics of this chapter.

# Chapter 2: Getting Started with Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Before diving into advanced simulations and humanoid control, it’s crucial to **set up your development environment**, understand the hardware requirements, and familiarize yourself with the tools used in this course. This chapter will guide you step by step.

## Introduction

Physical AI moves AI systems from the digital realm into the **physical world**, requiring a combination of:

- High-performance hardware for simulation  
- Edge devices for real-world deployment  
- Software frameworks for robot control  
- Sensors and actuators for interaction with the environment  

The goal is to bridge the gap between **AI reasoning** and **robotic action**, preparing you for building and simulating humanoid robots.

## Hardware Overview

### 1. Digital Twin Workstation (Simulation PC)

A powerful workstation is required to run NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Gazebo, and AI models efficiently.

**Recommended specs:**
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti or higher (RTX 3090/4090 ideal)  
- CPU: Intel Core i7 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 9  
- RAM: 64 GB DDR5 (32 GB minimum)  
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
- Notes: NVIDIA Isaac Sim requires RTX-enabled GPUs; dual-boot with Linux is recommended for ROS 2  

### 2. Physical AI Edge Kit

For deploying AI on physical robots or desk-top test rigs:

- Brain: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) or Orin NX (16GB)  
- Eyes: Intel RealSense D435i or D455 (RGB + Depth + IMU)  
- Ears: ReSpeaker USB microphone array  
- Misc: SD card, jumper wires, power supply  

### 3. Robot Lab Options

**Option A: Proxy Approach (Budget-Friendly)**  
- Robot: Unitree Go2 Edu (~$1,800 - $3,000)  
- Pros: Durable, ROS 2 compatible, affordable  
- Cons: Not humanoid (quadruped or arm as proxy)  

**Option B: Miniature Humanoid Approach**  
- Small humanoids like Hiwonder TonyPi Pro (~$600)  
- Can demonstrate kinematics and basic movement  
- AI control limited by hardware  

**Option C: Premium Lab (Full Humanoid)**  
- Robot: Unitree G1 Humanoid (~$16k+)  
- Full ROS 2 and NVIDIA Isaac ROS support  
- Supports real sim-to-real deployment

## Software Setup

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)

- ROS 2 Humble/Iron recommended  
- Install `rclpy` for Python node development  
- Supports nodes, topics, services, and actions  

### Simulation Environments

- **Gazebo:** Physics simulation and sensor testing  
- **Unity:** Visualization of robots and environments  
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim:** High-fidelity humanoid simulation and training  

### Development Tools

- Python 3.10+ for AI and ROS 2 integration  
- VS Code or PyCharm for code editing  
- Git and GitHub for version control  

---

## First Steps

1. Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on your workstation  
2. Install ROS 2 Humble/Iron and verify nodes can run  
3. Install Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim  
4. Connect your Edge AI kit and verify sensors  
5. Run a simple publisher-subscriber node to ensure ROS 2 communication works

## Best Practices

- **Start with simulation:** Always test in Gazebo or Isaac Sim before deploying to real robots  
- **Use version control:** Keep track of code changes using Git  
- **Monitor hardware:** High VRAM and CPU usage is common; avoid running heavy simulations alongside other software  
- **Document experiments:** Note your configurations, observations, and errors for future reference  

By completing this chapter, you’ll have a **ready-to-use environment** for building, simulating, and controlling humanoid robots, preparing you for the next chapters on ROS 2 fundamentals and AI integration.

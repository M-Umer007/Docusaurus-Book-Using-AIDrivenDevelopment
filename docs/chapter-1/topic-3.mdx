# Topic 3: Describing Humanoid Robots with URDF

To control a humanoid robot effectively, ROS 2 needs a precise understanding of its **physical structure**. This is where **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** comes in. URDF is an XML-based format that defines the **links**, **joints**, and physical properties of a robot, allowing ROS 2 to simulate and control it accurately.

## What URDF Represents

A humanoid robot is made up of multiple parts:

- **Links:** Rigid bodies, such as torso, head, arms, and legs  
- **Joints:** Connections between links, defining how they move (revolute, prismatic, fixed)  
- **Sensors:** Cameras, IMUs, LiDARs attached to specific links  
- **Actuators:** Motors controlling joints  
- **Origin & Pose:** Position and orientation of each link relative to its parent

URDF provides ROS 2 with a **map of the robot’s kinematics and geometry**, which is essential for simulation, motion planning, and AI control.

## Basic URDF Structure

A URDF file typically includes:

```xml
<robot name="humanoid">
  <link name="torso"/>
  <link name="head"/>
  <joint name="neck" type="revolute">
    <parent link="torso"/>
    <child link="head"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.3" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
    <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="10" velocity="1"/>
  </joint>
  <!-- Additional links and joints -->
</robot>
```

Key points:
- `<robot>` is the root element  
- `<link>` defines a rigid body  
- `<joint>` connects two links and defines the type of motion  
- `<origin>` specifies the position and orientation of the child link  
- `<axis>` defines the rotation axis (for revolute joints)  
- `<limit>` sets physical constraints for the joint

## URDF for Humanoid Robots

Humanoids have many degrees of freedom (DoF). Examples:

- Torso: fixed or small tilt joints  
- Head: pitch and yaw  
- Arms: shoulder, elbow, wrist  
- Legs: hip, knee, ankle  

URDF allows ROS 2 to **understand the hierarchy** of links and joints so that movement commands can propagate correctly through the robot.

## Integrating Sensors and Actuators

Sensors are added as links with special tags, such as `<camera>` or `<imu>`.  
Actuators are usually attached to joints, defining the **motion limits** and **control parameters**.

This allows AI models or ROS 2 controllers to:
- Read sensor data  
- Compute kinematics  
- Send commands to actuators

## Why URDF Is Critical

- Enables **simulation** in Gazebo or Isaac Sim  
- Provides the robot’s **kinematic and dynamic model**  
- Bridges the gap between software (ROS 2) and hardware (motors, sensors)  
- Essential for **path planning, collision avoidance, and humanoid motion**

In the next topic, we will explore **how AI agents and decision-making systems connect to ROS 2 controllers**, turning perception and planning into actual robot actions.

# About the Author

Umer is a computer science student and an aspiring AI engineer with a strong interest in **Physical AI, robotics, and AI-native systems**. His work focuses on bridging the gap between software intelligence and real-world physical execution.

He has experience with:
- Python and object-oriented programming
- AI and agent-based systems
- Web technologies such as Next.js and React
- Building simulation-first systems for learning and experimentation

This textbook was created as part of a hackathon initiative to explore **AI-native education** and to contribute learning material for **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. The goal is to make complex robotics and embodied AI concepts approachable for students coming from a software background.

Umer is continuously learning and experimenting with emerging AI tools, simulation platforms, and robotics frameworks.
